# Project_Python_Banyan
Create your GUI interface using TKinter, and write a multithreaded LAN-compatible distributed auction program using the Python Publish-Subscribe model.
Here are some guidelines for the design:

The clients may both be sellers and buyers.  The seller posts items for bidding and receives bids from interested buyers. The server receives all the bids and records the amount of the highest bid and the name of the bidder. Bidders are notified of the current highest bid. The highest bidder after a specified time is declared the winning bidder.
